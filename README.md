# The Great Normalizer: How the Central Limit Theorem Shapes Statistics

This project uses the Javascript D3 library to create a dynamic, interactive visualization of the Central Limit Theorem. 

The files in the [public](/public) directory are deployed to: https://cse442.pages.cs.washington.edu/25wi/fp/clt-statistics

## Motivation

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental result in statitics. It asserts that the distribution of sample means will converge to a normal distribution, so long as the sample size is sufficiently high. Despite its relevance in many science and mathematical fields, many students struggle to grasp the intuition and core concepts.

For our CSE 442: Data Visualization Final Project, our group decided to create a series of visualizations on the Central Limit Theorem. Interactivity and simulation are effective educational tools, and our project aims to leverage them to teach these concepts to students.
